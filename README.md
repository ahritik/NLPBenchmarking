# Project Proposal: NLP Model Benchmarking and Comparison 

### Overall Goal 

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of various NLP models retrained on different datasets to identify the most suitable model for a specific task. This will provide users with insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different models, helping them select the best model for their needs. 

### Scope 

The project will be limited to a prototype that involves: 

### Collecting and preprocessing datasets 

- Retraining three different NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT, and LSTM-based model) on selected datasets 

- Evaluating model performance using standard NLP metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and inference time 

- Visualizing and benchmarking the results to facilitate easy comparison

### Approaches 

Use transfer learning for model retraining 

Utilize libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers and TensorFlow/PyTorch for model implementation 

Optimize models using grid search or random search hyperparameter tuning 

Evaluate models on common NLP tasks such as text classification or sentiment analysis 

This project will not only provide benchmarking insights but also serve as a hands-on learning opportunity in various aspects of NLP model development.
